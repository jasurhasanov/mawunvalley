The farm has goats, ducks and many fruit trees. We got local food 3 times a day, 7 days a week. The beach is within 25 minutes walking distance. I've had a great time here!",

    text: "Staying at Mawun Valley Farm was an incredible experience. It was my very first time living for a whole month far from the city, fully immersed in nature and local life. The peaceful environment helped me disconnect and reset. If you're a surfer, this place is a hidden gem—only 10-15 minutes from Mawi Beach with world-class waves.",
