*Written for: Dutch, French, and international families who have recently moved to South Lombok and are looking for wholesome activities for their children.*

If you've recently relocated to South Lombok with your family — whether to Kuta, Selong Belanak, or anywhere in between — you're probably discovering that this corner of Indonesia offers something special: a chance to raise children closer to nature, away from screens, with dirt under their fingernails and wonder in their eyes.

But finding **quality family activities** that go beyond the beach can be challenging. Where do you take the kids on a Saturday morning? How do you find experiences that are both fun and enriching?

We've put together this guide specifically for expat families in South Lombok — the activities that local international families return to again and again.

## 1. Farm Visits: Where Kids Meet Animals & Nature

There's something magical about watching your child's face light up when a baby goat nibbles their hand for the first time. **Farm visits** offer children hands-on experiences that simply can't be replicated on a screen.

At [Mawun Valley Farm](/experience), kids can:
- Meet and feed friendly goats, chickens, and other farm animals
- Learn where their food comes from
- Pick fresh vegetables and fruits
- Run freely in safe, open green spaces
- Make new friends with other expat children

Many Dutch and French families we know make farm visits a **weekly tradition** — it becomes their children's favorite part of the week.

## 2. Beach Days Done Right

Yes, the beaches are obvious — but not all beaches are equal for families. Here's what works:

**Selong Belanak** is the go-to for families with young children. The gentle waves and shallow waters make it safe for toddlers, while older kids can try their first surf lessons.

**Mawun Beach** offers a quieter alternative, especially on weekdays. The crescent bay feels protected, and there's enough shade for picnics.

**Pro tip:** Arrive early (before 9am) to beat the heat and have the beach almost to yourselves.

## 3. Nature Walks & Easy Hikes

South Lombok's landscape is perfect for family exploration. The rice paddies around Kuta offer easy walking paths where children can spot water buffalo, dragonflies, and countless birds.

For families with older children, the walk up to **Bukit Merese** (Merese Hill) rewards you with panoramic views of Tanjung Aan — and it's manageable for kids aged 6 and up.

## 4. Cooking & Baking Experiences

Our [Gather program](/gather) offers family-friendly cooking experiences, including our popular **Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Class**.

Children who cook become children who eat. Several places in South Lombok offer family-friendly cooking experiences where kids can:
- Make their own pizza or bread
- Learn to bake cakes and cookies
- Try Indonesian cooking basics

These experiences work especially well for rainy days or when you want a break from the sun.

## 5. Building a Routine: The Family Membership Approach

Many expat families find that the best approach isn't one-off activities, but building **regular routines**. Our [Belong program](/belong) is designed exactly for this. Some local farms offer family membership programs where you can:
- Visit regularly at discounted rates
- Watch animals and gardens grow over time
- Build relationships with other families
- Give children a sense of ownership and belonging

There's something powerful about a child saying "let's go check on the goats" — they've formed a connection to place.

## What Other Expat Families Say

> "After moving from Amsterdam, we worried about finding activities for our two kids. The weekly farm visits have become our anchor — the kids talk about the goats all week." — Dutch family, Kuta

## Planning Your Family's South Lombok Life

The families who thrive here are the ones who embrace the slower pace. Your children don't need a packed schedule — they need **unstructured time in nature**, animals to care for, and a community of friends.

South Lombok offers all of this, if you know where to look.
