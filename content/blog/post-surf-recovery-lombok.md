You've just had an epic dawn patrol at Gerupuk. Shoulders burning, stoked out of your mind. Now what? The hours between sessions are just as important as the time in the water.

## Why Recovery Matters for Surfers

Surfing is deceptively demanding. You're working shoulders, core, legs, and cardiovascular system simultaneously. Add tropical heat, strong currents, and multiple sessions per day — your body needs intentional recovery.

**Common issues without proper recovery:**
- Shoulder inflammation and paddling fatigue
- Lower back tightness
- Dehydration and energy crashes
- Poor sleep affecting reaction time

## Post-Surf Nutrition

### Within 30 Minutes: The Recovery Window

Your body absorbs nutrients best right after exercise. Prioritize:
- **Protein:** Eggs, tempeh, chicken, fish
- **Carbs:** Rice, banana, sweet potato
- **Electrolytes:** Coconut water, or add salt to your water

### Best Post-Surf Meals

**At warungs:** Nasi campur is perfect — protein, rice, vegetables, sambal. Complete meal for IDR 25-40k.

**Farm-fresh option:** At [Noni's Café](/nonis), we serve fresh food made with ingredients from the farm — great for surfers who want real nutrition.

## Stretching & Yoga for Surfers

Even 15 minutes makes a difference.

### Key Stretches
- **Shoulders:** Cross-body stretch, doorway chest stretch
- **Lower back:** Cat-cow, child's pose, supine twist
- **Hips:** Pigeon pose, lizard pose
- **Neck:** Gentle neck rolls

Our [Experience program](/experience) includes morning yoga designed for active travelers.

## Rest Day Activities

Your body needs complete rest days. Active recovery works best:

- **Farm visits** — light activity, being in nature without strain
- **Beach walks** — explore beaches you wouldn't normally surf
- **Exploring the hills** — light hiking to viewpoints like Bukit Merese

## Massage & Bodywork

1-hour massage: IDR 100-200k ($6-13). Even daily massages are affordable here.

**Pro tip:** Book a massage for late afternoon on rest days. Then shower, eat well, sleep early. You'll feel reborn for dawn patrol.

## A Perfect Recovery Day

- **7:00am:** Wake naturally (no alarm!)
- **8:00am:** Big breakfast
- **9:30am:** Yoga or stretching
- **11:00am:** [Farm visit](/experience) or light activity
- **1:00pm:** Healthy lunch
- **2:00pm:** Rest, read, nap
- **4:00pm:** Massage
- **5:30pm:** Sunset viewpoint walk
- **7:00pm:** Early dinner
- **9:00pm:** In bed, phone away

Do this once or twice a week, and you'll surf better, feel better, and avoid injuries.
