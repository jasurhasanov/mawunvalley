Lombok isn't just beautiful beaches — it's home to the Sasak people, whose culture makes this island truly special.

## Who Are the Sasak?

The indigenous people of Lombok, making up about 85% of the island's population. Their culture blends indigenous traditions with Islamic faith.

## Traditional Villages

### Sade Village
Preserves ancestral Sasak architecture. Women weave textiles on traditional looms.

### Ende Village
Known for ikat weaving, less touristy. Weaving can take months to complete.

## Sasak Cuisine

- **Ayam Taliwang:** Spicy grilled chicken — the iconic Lombok dish
- **Plecing Kangkung:** Water spinach with spicy sambal
- **Beberuk Terong:** Mashed eggplant with chili
- **Sate Rembiga:** Distinctive beef satay

Our [Noni's Café](/nonis) serves authentic Sasak dishes.

## Islamic Traditions

Lombok is predominantly Muslim. You'll hear the call to prayer five times daily.

**Respectful visiting:**
- Cover shoulders and knees away from beaches
- Remove shoes when entering homes
- Ask before photographing people

## Farm Life

Agriculture remains central to Sasak life. At [Mawun Valley Farm](/experience), we blend traditional Sasak farming with modern permaculture.
