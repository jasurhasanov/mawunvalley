There's something about South Lombok sunsets. The light hits the hills differently, fishing boats return to shore, and watching the day end here feels like a gift — especially with someone you love.

## 1. Bukit Merese — The Classic

**Best for:** Stunning panoramic views, hilltop magic  
**Crowd level:** Popular but spacious  
**Effort:** 10-15 minute uphill walk

This grassy hilltop overlooking Tanjung Aan is South Lombok's most famous sunset spot — for good reason. 360-degree views include the twin bays, rolling hills, and on clear days, Mount Rinjani.

**Romantic tip:** Arrive 45 minutes before sunset. Find a spot away from the crowd, bring a sarong to sit on, and maybe a small picnic.

## 2. Mawun Beach — Quiet Elegance

**Best for:** Beach sunset without crowds  
**Crowd level:** Quiet  
**Effort:** Just drive and park

Mawun is one of South Lombok's most beautiful beaches, and somehow stays quieter than others. The crescent bay catches beautiful light.

If you're [staying at Mawun Valley Farm](/stay), Mawun Beach is just 10 minutes away — catch sunset and return for dinner.

## 3. Seger Beach Viewpoint — Dramatic & Uncrowded

**Best for:** Dramatic cliffs and coastal views  
**Crowd level:** Usually quiet  
**Effort:** Short walk from road

Just past Seger Beach, there's a clifftop with stunning views. Less famous than Merese but equally beautiful.

**Romantic tip:** Great for privacy. Watch for the "green flash" just as the sun dips below the horizon.

## 4. Selong Belanak — Beach Vibes

**Best for:** Feet in the sand, casual sunset  
**Crowd level:** Moderate  
**Effort:** Easy

The long beach faces perfectly west. More social vibe — surfers coming in, warungs serving drinks — but that can be part of the romance.

**Romantic tip:** Grab beanbags at a beach bar and watch surfers catch final waves.

## 5. Your Private Spot

The truth is, South Lombok has dozens of unnamed viewpoints and quiet beaches. Rent a scooter, start driving west in the afternoon, and stop when something catches your eye.

**Romantic tip:** Don't look at your phone. Just ride, explore, trust that you'll find somewhere perfect.

## Making It Special

### What to Bring
- Sarong or blanket
- Cold drinks (grab from a warung)
- Light snacks
- Camera (but use sparingly)
- Mosquito repellent

### Timing

Sunset is around 6:00-6:30pm year-round. Arrive 45-60 minutes early. Stay 15-20 minutes after — often the best colors come after the sun disappears.
