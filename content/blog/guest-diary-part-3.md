*About the Author: Ava is a traveller from the UK documenting her stay at Mawun Valley Farm. This is the final part of her 3-part diary series. [Start from Part 1](/blog/guest-diary-part-1)*

*Beyond the goats and cinnamon rolls, Mawun Valley has a beating heart of sustainability and community. Here's what I discovered about the farm's deeper purpose.*

## Sustainability at Heart

Sustainability lies at the heart of [Mawun Valley](/experience), evident in the improvement of soil pH and the enrichment of the ground. This is why **compost** is important. In order to grow high quality produce, the ground they bloom from must be healthy.

At the far end of the farm is the compost pile. Only organic waste such as vegetables, egg shells, and plant matter are used — decayed organic material that becomes natural fertilizer.

## The Keyhole Compost Project

Some guests have started building a **keyhole compost** — a raised, circular shaped garden bed with a central composting basket. The design originated in sub-Saharan Africa, created for nutrient-poor and dry environments.

The process began by chopping up logs of different heights to create the walls, lining them in a circular pattern and hammering them into the ground. Then a compost basket made with wood and wired net sits in the centre. The space gets filled with soil, and compost goes in the centre where flowers and vegetables can then be planted.

*Every corner of the farm tells a story of creativity and care*

The beauty of this design is both convenience and sustainability. The worms can weave their way in and out of the compost and the plants surrounding it — the magic works itself. The raised bed also means less frequent watering.

> This kind of innovation makes gardening and permaculture accessible to everyone. It's about using what you have and making it work. Anyone can create their own version — it epitomises sustainability in one's own garden.

## Ancient Wisdom: Olla Irrigation

The farm also uses **Olla irrigation**, an ancient water-saving method that uses clay pots buried in the soil to hold water and then release it slowly to the surrounding plants. It is an environmentally conscious method as the unglazed, porous material can decompose naturally.

This technique reduces water usage and encourages roots of the plants to stretch deeper into the ground, making them more resistant to dry conditions. Ancient wisdom meeting modern sustainability.

## Creative Projects & Personal Touches

Each nook and cranny of the farm is the creation of many guests' personal projects. Rick stayed at the farm for three months and built a beautiful seating area in the Markisa gardens — he's really considered part of the furniture here (given how much furniture he built!).

Other projects include painted signs for the different garden areas, a volleyball net for the sports field, and even a "Little Free Library" in the works — a small wooden bookshelf where guests can swap books in different languages.

Mawun Valley embraces diversity, as guests leave their imprint on the farm and form bonds with people from all over the world. The farm is a quiet archive whilst still ever growing with new developments. **Creativity takes root in Mawun's soil and integrity brings it to life.**

## Tony: The Head Farmer

Tony is the head farmer at Mawun. He comes every day to work his magic — maintaining, pruning and planting. He always makes our day with his positive energy and we enjoy learning about different ways of planting.

At the weekend he oversees the plants with care and intention. He is the master of his craft and always works hard with a smile on his face.

## Why This Place Feels Like Home

I grew up spending my summers camping in North Wales. For me, the farm brings up strong feelings of **nostalgia** when seeing children run around near the animals. It is reminiscent of a life removed from superficial spaces — dirtying one's hands and feet, no screens or distractions. Just simple, stripped back time spent with loved ones.

*Mawun Valley — where strangers become family*

It is a place I wish my family could visit with me, but I do not feel homesick when staying at Mawun. This green haven is a refined wilderness retreat that lets people experience a new lifestyle, in addition to providing guests with an escape from their own.

As I write this final entry, I realise that Mawun Valley isn't just a place to stay — it's a place to [**belong**](/belong).
