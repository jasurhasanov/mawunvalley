Most people only know the cashew nut. But cashew trees are fascinating plants with a surprising secret: the nut is only a small part of the story.

## What Is a Cashew Tree?

**Anacardium occidentale** is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. Here in Lombok, cashew trees thrive in our warm climate.

- Height: 10-12 meters typical
- Lifespan: 30+ years productive
- Yield: 20-30 kg nuts per tree annually

## The Strange Anatomy

The cashew nut hangs *outside* the fruit, not inside. What we call the "cashew apple" is actually a swollen fruit stem.

## Growing Cashews

### Requirements
- Tropical climate (no frost)
- Temperature: 20-30°C ideal
- Well-drained sandy or loamy soil

## Processing the Nut

This is why cashews cost what they do:
1. Drying the nuts
2. Roasting to release shell oil
3. Manual shelling
4. Peeling and grading

## The Forgotten Apple

Most farms discard the apple after removing the nut. But it's edible, nutritious, and delicious when prepared properly.
