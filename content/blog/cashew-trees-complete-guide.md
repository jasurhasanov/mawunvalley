*From our farm: Mawun Valley is home to 6 large cashew trees. During harvest season (Mid August - Mid December), we offer [Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Classes](https://megatix.co.id/events/cashew-apple-jam-cooking-class-at-mawun-valley-farm).*

The cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale) is one of nature's most fascinating plants. Native to Brazil, it has become a cornerstone of tropical agriculture across Asia and Africa — and it produces not one, but two edible products.

## Understanding the Cashew Tree

Cashew trees are evergreen tropical trees that can grow up to 12 meters tall. They thrive in tropical climates with distinct wet and dry seasons — making places like **Lombok, Indonesia** ideal for cultivation.

The trees are remarkably hardy once established, tolerating poor soils and drought conditions. They begin producing fruit after 3-5 years and can remain productive for 25-30 years.

## The Unique Cashew Fruit

Here's what surprises most people: **the cashew "nut" is actually a seed**, and it grows attached to a fruit called the cashew apple.

The cashew apple is a pear-shaped fruit, yellow or red when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. While the world obsesses over the nut, the fruit is often discarded — which is a shame, because it's delicious and nutritious.

At [our farm](/experience), we use both parts of the cashew harvest. Nothing goes to waste.

## Growing Conditions

- **Climate:** Tropical, 20-30°C, with distinct wet and dry seasons
- **Rainfall:** 1000-2000mm annually
- **Soil:** Well-draining, sandy or loamy (tolerates poor soil)
- **Altitude:** Sea level to 1000m
- **Sunlight:** Full sun required

## Harvesting Season

In Indonesia, cashew harvest typically runs from **August through December**, with peak season in September-October. The fruit falls naturally when ripe, making harvesting straightforward.

At Mawun Valley Farm, we harvest from our 6 mature cashew trees during this season. It's a special time on the farm — the trees heavy with yellow and red fruit, the sweet smell in the air.

## Processing Cashew Nuts

The nut must be processed carefully. The shell contains urushiol — the same irritant found in poison ivy — so proper roasting and shelling is essential. This is traditionally done by skilled workers and is not something to attempt casually.

## Using Cashew Apples

The cashew apple, however, is safe and simple to use:

- Eaten fresh (very perishable, must be consumed within hours)
- Made into juice or smoothies
- Fermented into alcoholic beverages (feni in India)
- Cooked into **jam** — our specialty at the farm

## Experience Cashew Harvest at Our Farm

During harvest season (Mid August - Mid December), we offer a unique [Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Class](/gather). You'll:

- Pick ripe cashew apples from our trees
- Learn traditional processing techniques
- Make your own jar of cashew apple jam
