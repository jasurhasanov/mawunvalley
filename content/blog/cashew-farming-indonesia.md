Indonesia is one of the world's largest cashew producers, with small farms scattered across the eastern islands.

## Cashews in Indonesian History

Cashews arrived in Indonesia during the Portuguese colonial era, introduced from their native Brazil. Today, Indonesia produces approximately 150,000 tons annually.

## Where Cashews Grow

- **Sulawesi:** Largest producing region
- **Nusa Tenggara (including Lombok):** Significant production
- **East Java:** Growing industry

## Small Farm Reality

Indonesian cashew production is dominated by smallholders:
- Average farm: 0.5-2 hectares
- Family labor for harvest and processing
- Trees often intercropped with other plants

## Supporting Local Farmers

At [Mawun Valley Farm](/experience), we:
- Grow our own cashew trees sustainably
- Process nuts locally
- Use the cashew apples (which most farms discard)
