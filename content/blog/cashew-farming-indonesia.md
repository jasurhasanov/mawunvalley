Indonesia is among the world's top cashew producers, with cultivation spanning from Lombok to Sulawesi, Flores to Sumba. This versatile crop has become an important part of rural Indonesian agriculture and economy.

## Indonesia's Cashew Growing Regions

Cashew thrives in Indonesia's tropical climate. Major growing regions include:

- **Sulawesi** — Indonesia's largest producer
- **Nusa Tenggara** — including Lombok, Sumbawa, and Flores
- **East Java** — particularly Madura island
- **Bali** — smaller scale, often organic

In **South Lombok**, cashew trees dot the landscape, especially in the drier southern hills. The climate here — hot, with distinct wet and dry seasons — is ideal for cashew production.

## The Indonesian Cashew Season

Harvest season in Indonesia typically runs from **August through December**, with peak production in September and October. This coincides with the dry season, when the fruit ripens best.

During harvest, farming communities come alive. It's a time of work, but also celebration — the cashew harvest represents important income for rural families.

## Small-Scale vs. Commercial Farming

Indonesian cashew farming exists on a spectrum:

**Commercial plantations** focus purely on nut production for export. The cashew apple is typically discarded — a massive waste of nutritious fruit.

**Small farms**, like ours at Mawun Valley, take a different approach. We value both the nut and the fruit, using the apple for jam, juice, and cooking classes. This [permaculture approach](/experience) creates more value and less waste.

## Cashew's Role in Rural Livelihoods

For many Indonesian farming families, cashew provides:

- Reliable seasonal income
- A drought-resistant crop (insurance against poor rice harvests)
- Trees that improve soil over time
- Shade for other crops (agroforestry)

The trees require minimal inputs once established, making them ideal for smallholders with limited resources.

## Experience Indonesian Cashew Culture

At [Mawun Valley Farm](/stay), visitors can experience cashew farming firsthand. During harvest season (Mid August - Mid December), we offer:

- Farm tours including our cashew orchard
- [Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Classes](/gather)
- Tastings of fresh cashew apple (rare experience!)
