If you're burnt out on Bali's traffic, $15 smoothie bowls, and fighting for café tables — South Lombok might be exactly what you need. Fewer nomads means more peace, lower costs, and beaches you can actually have to yourself.

## The WiFi Situation (Let's Be Real)

South Lombok isn't Ubud. You won't find blazing fiber everywhere. But it's gotten significantly better.

### What to Expect
- **Café WiFi:** 10-30 Mbps typical in Kuta town
- **Accommodation WiFi:** Varies wildly — ask before booking
- **Mobile data (backup):** Telkomsel 4G is decent (20-50GB for IDR 100-200k)

### Pro Tips
- Always test before booking long stays
- Have a mobile hotspot as backup
- Schedule important calls for morning (faster speeds)

## Best Places to Work From

### Cafés with Good WiFi
- **Milk Espresso:** Reliable WiFi, AC, good coffee
- **El Bazar:** Nice atmosphere, decent connection
- **Ashtari:** Incredible views, WiFi okay

Our [Noni's Café](/nonis) at Mawun Valley is a quieter option with farm views — great for focused work.

## Monthly Cost Breakdown

| Expense | Monthly (USD) |
|---------|--------------|
| Accommodation | $260-520 |
| Food | $195-325 |
| Scooter | $52-78 |
| Data + Activities | $107-208 |
| **Total** | **$615-1,130** |

Compare that to Canggu where accommodation alone can be $800-1,500/month.

## A Typical Day

- **6:30am:** Sunrise surf or beach walk
- **8:00am:** Breakfast and emails
- **9:00am-1:00pm:** Deep work (mornings are gold)
- **1:00pm:** Lunch at a warung (IDR 25-35k)
- **2:00pm-5:00pm:** Lighter tasks or break
- **5:30pm:** Sunset at one of the viewpoints
- **7:00pm:** Dinner, wind down

## Is South Lombok Right for You?

### ✅ Yes, if you:
- Can work asynchronously (not constant video calls)
- Value peace over nightlife
- Are self-motivated
- Want to save money while living well

### ❌ Maybe not, if you:
- Need ultra-reliable high-speed internet
- Want bustling coworking scenes
- Prefer urban convenience

For longer stays, consider our [Belong program](/belong) — designed for people staying weeks or months who want community and purpose.
