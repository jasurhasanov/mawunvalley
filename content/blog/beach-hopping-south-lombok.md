## Beach Hopping Tips

- **Rent a motorbike** — most convenient way to explore (50-75k IDR/day)
- **Go early** — beat the heat and have beaches to yourself
- **Bring cash** — most warungs don't take cards
- **Wear sunscreen** — the equatorial sun is strong
- **Stay hydrated** — coconuts are everywhere

## Your Base for Beach Adventures

[Mawun Valley Farm](/stay) is perfectly positioned for beach hopping. Start your day with breakfast at [Noni's](/nonis), grab a scooter, and you can hit 3-4 beaches before sunset. Return for dinner and stargazing.
