*About the Author: Ava is a traveller from the UK documenting her stay at Mawun Valley Farm. This is Part 2 of her 3-part diary series. [Read Part 1](/blog/guest-diary-part-1)*

*What does a typical day look like at Mawun Valley Farm? Let me walk you through mine — from sunrise yoga to evenings under the stars.*

## Morning: Sunrise on Heal Hill

It is early morning and I have risen around 6:30am. An early start is perfect when on top of the "Heal Hill." A few of us recently completed our yoga teacher training whilst in Indonesia, so this is the perfect way to start our day, with the kittens accompanying our sun salutation.

It is a quiet time of the day. As we salute the sun towards the end of the ritual, the sun rays caress our faces, spilling over the adjacent hills. A beautiful way to start the morning in a safe, peaceful space.

By 8am I'm sitting with the kittens who sleep peacefully atop the amphitheatre whilst I enjoy a **Lombok coffee**. Then comes breakfast — a fresh omelette cooked with spring onions, white onions and juicy tomatoes, all grown right here at Mawun.

## The Cozy Lodges

Each lodge is named uniquely with beautiful painted signs, giving the [accommodation](/stay) that added charm. The "Lime" hut, where I am staying, is situated just next to the citrus garden — painted green and yellow to accompany the neighbouring lemons and limes.

Each cabin is warmly furnished with a fan and a plush, comfortable bed. You may view this green haven as a refined wilderness retreat, rather than just a glamping spot in rural Lombok. It lets people experience a new lifestyle, in addition to providing guests with an escape from their own.

## Afternoon: Exploring South Lombok

Around 9am we proceed with our projects under the jackfruit tree. Then I set out to explore South Lombok on a rented moped, visiting **Selong Belanak beach** for a surf or to relax on the white sand.

I return in the afternoon to the tranquility of the farm to relax, feasting on a homemade fresh fluffy cinnamon roll baked by [Noni](/nonis), alongside a black tea. Tea in this region is deeply ingrained into the culture, symbolising hospitality.

## Evening: Food, Football & Firelight

In the evening we indulge in a spread that Noni and the kitchen team provide — fried tofu, tempeh, chicken, sometimes a saucy yellowfin fish. Then play football or various games until we drop and settle into the quiet of our cabins. A beautiful day in the Lombok hills.

Various string lights dotted around the farm illuminate the area at night, hanging above the amphitheatre to make it feel cosy. Some evenings there's a chance to roast marshmallows on a campfire.

> Guests and staff mingle and become a family-like unit during each person's stay at Mawun Valley — although the intense football matches we play can make or break these bonds!

## Heal Hill: The Perfect View

Beyond the vegetable patches and the nursery, there is a chilled corner called "Heal Hill" for anyone seeking peace. There you can enjoy the view over the farm and the landscape beyond.

A picture perfect view, whether in the daytime relaxing, or gathered around the fire pit at night watching the stars appear one by one.

Mawun Valley is perfect for someone who wants a peaceful stay but also seeks a sort of familial comfort. The family loves spending time with their guests which sets Mawun apart from your average accommodation — hosting [Friday night barbecues](/gather) where you can enjoy delectable fish, meat or tofu and tempeh.
