*The rooster crows at dawn, but it's the gentle bleating of goats that truly wakes me. Another day at Mawun Valley Farm begins.*

## Morning Routine

The morning light filters through the bamboo blinds of my cabin. I've learned to embrace the farm's rhythm — early to rise, early to rest.

Breakfast is always a highlight. Today it's farm-fresh eggs with vegetables picked just hours ago, accompanied by homemade jam on toast. The coffee is strong and local.

## Contributing to the Farm

As a volunteer, I spend about 3 hours each morning helping with farm tasks. Today's job: tending to the vegetable garden.

The work varies day to day:
- Feeding the goats and chickens
- Watering the herb garden
- Harvesting ripe vegetables
- Painting and decorating projects

## Afternoon Freedom

After lunch, the afternoon is mine. Some days I grab a bike and ride to Mawun Beach — just 5 minutes away.

## Evening Magic

As the sun begins to set, the farm transforms. On Fridays, we gather for BBQ night — the highlight of the week. Fresh fish from local fishermen, vegetables from the garden, and Noni's legendary sambal.

> The sense of community here is unlike anywhere I've traveled. We're not just guests — we're family.
