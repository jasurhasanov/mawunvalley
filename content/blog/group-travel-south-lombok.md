Travelling with friends is one of life's great joys — and South Lombok is practically designed for it. Empty beaches, cheap scooter rentals, sunset sessions, and enough activities to keep everyone happy.

## Best Group Accommodation Options

### Multiple Cabins or Bungalows

Rather than cramming into one villa, many groups book several cabins at the same property. At [Mawun Valley Farm](/stay), groups can book our cabins and lodges — you each get your own space but share common areas, meals, and the experience.

**Why this works:**
- Everyone has their own space (crucial for group harmony)
- Couples can have privacy
- Common areas for socializing
- Often cheaper than large villas

## Activities That Work for Groups

### Everyone Loves: Beach Days

South Lombok's beaches are spacious enough that even large groups don't feel crowded. **Selong Belanak** is ideal for mixed-ability groups — beginners can surf the gentle whitewash while stronger surfers head outside.

### Split & Reconvene

Not everyone needs to do everything together:
- **Surfers:** Dawn patrol at Gerupuk or Selong
- **Adventurous ones:** Waterfall chases, cliff jumping
- **Relaxed crew:** Beach lounging, massage sessions
- **Curious types:** [Farm visits](/experience), cooking classes

### Group-Only Activities

Plan 2-3 activities the whole group does together:
- **Sunset at Bukit Merese** — the classic
- **Group surf lesson** — watching friends fall is half the fun
- **BBQ night** — our [Gather program](/gather) hosts group dinners
- **Day trip to Gili Islands** — snorkeling, beach clubs

## Budget Breakdown

Typical daily spend per person in a group of 6:
- **Accommodation:** $13-23 per person sharing
- **Food:** $10-17
- **Scooter:** $2.50 sharing
- **Activities:** $7-13

**Total:** $33-55 per day per person

## Pro Tips

1. **Agree on non-negotiables early** — what does everyone absolutely need to do?
2. **Create a shared expense tracker** — Splitwise saves friendships
3. **Schedule free time** — even best friends need breaks
4. **Book 2-3 weeks ahead** in peak season
