Cashew apple jam is a rare delicacy — partly because the fruit is so perishable, and partly because the techniques are passed down through local tradition rather than cookbooks. Here's how we make it at Mawun Valley Farm.

## Ingredients

- **1 kg ripe cashew apples** (yellow or red, freshly picked)
- **500g sugar** (adjust to taste)
- **Juice of 2 limes**
- **1 cup water**
- **Pinch of salt**
- **Optional:** cinnamon stick, vanilla, or ginger for flavor

## Equipment

- Large heavy-bottomed pot
- Wooden spoon
- Blender or food processor
- Fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth
- Sterilized glass jars

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Cashew Apples

Remove the cashew nuts (these are processed separately — don't eat them raw!). Wash the cashew apples thoroughly. Work quickly — the fruit begins to ferment within hours of picking.

### Step 2: Extract the Juice

Chop the cashew apples roughly. Blend until smooth, then strain through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Press firmly to extract all the juice. You should get about 600-700ml from 1kg of fruit.

### Step 3: Reduce the Juice

Pour the juice into a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by about one-third. This concentrates the flavor and removes excess water.

### Step 4: Add Sugar

Add sugar gradually, stirring to dissolve. The amount can be adjusted — start with less and add more to taste. Add the lime juice and salt.

### Step 5: Cook to Jam Consistency

Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning. The mixture will thicken gradually. This takes 45-60 minutes.

**Test for doneness:** Drop a small amount on a cold plate. If it wrinkles when pushed with your finger, it's ready.

### Step 6: Jar and Store

Pour hot jam into sterilized jars. Seal immediately. Once cooled, store in the refrigerator for up to 3 months, or process in a water bath for longer shelf life.

## Tips for Success

- **Use ripe fruit:** Yellow or red, with a strong aroma
- **Work fast:** Fresh cashew apples ferment quickly
- **Stir constantly** in the final stages to prevent burning
- **Taste as you go:** Adjust sweetness to your preference

## Serving Suggestions

- On toast or fresh bread
- With cheese (pairs beautifully with soft cheeses)
- As a glaze for grilled meats
- Swirled into yogurt
- In [baked goods](/nonis) like thumbprint cookies

## The Challenge: Finding Fresh Cashew Apples

The hardest part of making cashew apple jam? Getting the fruit. Cashew apples can't be shipped — they must be used within hours of harvest. This means you need to:

1. Be in a cashew-growing region
2. Visit during harvest season (Mid August - Mid December in Indonesia)
3. Have access to fresh fruit

This is exactly why we offer our [Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Class](/gather) at the farm. We provide the fresh fruit, the equipment, the expertise — you leave with a jar of jam and the knowledge to recreate it (if you can find the fruit!).
