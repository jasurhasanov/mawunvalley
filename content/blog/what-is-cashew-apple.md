You know the cashew nut. But have you met its parent — the cashew apple?

## The Hidden Fruit

The cashew "nut" isn't a nut at all. It's a seed, and it grows outside of a fruit — the cashew apple.

## Why You've Never Seen One

Cashew apples are highly perishable — they bruise easily and spoil within 24 hours. No shelf life means no export market.

## What Do They Taste Like?

Sweet and tangy — like a mix of mango and bell pepper. Perfect for juice, jams, and fermented drinks.

## Cashew Apples at Mawun Valley

Our farm has 6 large cashew trees. During harvest season (mid-August to mid-December), we run **Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Classes**.
