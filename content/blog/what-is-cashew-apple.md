Everyone knows the cashew nut. But how many people have tasted the fruit it grows from? Meet the cashew apple — arguably the world's most wasted tropical fruit.

## The Fruit Behind the Nut

Here's the surprising truth: the part we call a "cashew nut" is actually a seed. The **cashew apple** is the real fruit — a colorful, aromatic, nutritious fruit that 95% of the world has never tasted.

Why? Because cashew apples are incredibly perishable. Within 24 hours of falling from the tree, they begin to ferment. This makes commercial export impossible — and means most of the world's cashew apple harvest (millions of tons annually) simply rots on the ground.

## What Does Cashew Apple Taste Like?

The flavor is unique and complex:

- **Sweet and tangy** — like a mix of mango, citrus, and bell pepper
- **Astringent** — a slight drying sensation in the mouth
- **Aromatic** — tropical and fragrant
- **Juicy** — extremely high water content

It's an acquired taste for some, but lovers of unusual tropical fruits often become obsessed.

## Nutritional Powerhouse

The cashew apple is remarkably nutritious — containing **5 times more Vitamin C than an orange**. It's also rich in:

- Vitamin C (exceptionally high)
- Iron
- Phosphorus
- Calcium
- Antioxidants

In countries where it's consumed (Brazil, India, parts of Africa), cashew apple is valued as a health food.

## Why Most People Have Never Tried It

Three reasons:

1. **Extreme perishability** — can't be shipped fresh
2. **Focus on the nut** — the export industry cares only about cashew nuts
3. **Geographic limitation** — you must be where cashews grow during harvest season

This makes tasting fresh cashew apple a **rare experience** — available only to those who visit tropical cashew-growing regions during harvest.

## How Cashew Apple is Used

In places where it's not wasted, cashew apple becomes:

- **Fresh juice** — highly refreshing, consumed same day
- **Feni (India)** — a distilled alcoholic spirit
- **Jam** — our specialty at Mawun Valley Farm
- **Vinegar** — used in cooking
- **Animal feed** — in some areas

## Experience Cashew Apple in Lombok

At [Mawun Valley Farm](/experience), we have 6 mature cashew trees. During harvest season (Mid August - Mid December), we offer the chance to taste this rare fruit and learn to make jam from it.

Our [Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Class](/gather) is one of the few places in the world where tourists can experience the complete journey from tree to jar.
