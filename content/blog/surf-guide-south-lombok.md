*Written for: Surfers planning a trip to South Lombok — from beginners looking for mellow waves to experienced riders chasing barrels.*

South Lombok has quietly become one of Indonesia's premier surf destinations. While Bali's breaks get crowded, this southern coastline offers world-class waves with a fraction of the crowd — plus a laid-back vibe that keeps surfers coming back season after season.

Whether you're learning to stand up for the first time or hunting for overhead barrels, this guide covers everything you need to know about **surfing South Lombok** in 2026.

## Best Surf Spots in South Lombok

### For Beginners: Selong Belanak

**Selong Belanak** is where most surfers start their Lombok journey. The long, crescent-shaped beach produces gentle, rolling whitewash perfect for learning. Board rentals and lessons are available right on the beach.

- **Wave type:** Mellow beach break, left and right
- **Best for:** First-timers, longboarders, anyone wanting a cruisy session
- **Crowd factor:** Medium (busier at peak hours)

### For Intermediate: Mawun Beach

**Mawun** offers a step up from Selong with slightly more powerful waves. The reef break on the right side delivers fun, workable walls when conditions align.

- **Wave type:** Beach break with reef section
- **Best for:** Intermediate surfers progressing their skills
- **Crowd factor:** Low — often uncrowded

### For Experienced: Gerupuk Bay

**Gerupuk** is where things get serious. This bay holds multiple reef breaks accessible by boat — Don Don, Kid's Point, Outside, and Inside — offering variety from playful to punchy.

- **Wave type:** Reef breaks (boat access)
- **Best for:** Intermediate to advanced surfers
- **Crowd factor:** Varies by break

### For Advanced: Ekas Bay

**Ekas**, further east, serves up some of Lombok's most powerful waves. Inside Ekas and Outside Ekas can hold serious size, and the barrels here are the stuff of legend.

- **Wave type:** Powerful reef breaks
- **Best for:** Experienced surfers comfortable in hollow waves
- **Crowd factor:** Low — worth the drive

## Surf Season Calendar

South Lombok's waves are influenced by two swells:

**Dry Season (May - October):** The prime season. Consistent south swells light up the coast. Offshore winds in the morning make for clean conditions. This is when the waves are at their best and most consistent.

**Wet Season (November - April):** Less consistent, but still surfable. You'll score on north swells hitting certain breaks, and the crowds thin out significantly. Great for intermediate surfers wanting empty lineups.

## Where to Stay: Beyond the Typical Surf Camp

Most surfers default to beachfront hostels in Kuta — but there's another option that's gaining popularity: **staying slightly inland** at [farm stays like ours](/stay) and rural retreats.

Why? The benefits are real:

- **Better sleep:** Quieter nights away from bar noise
- **Healthier food:** [Farm-fresh meals at Noni's](/nonis) beat tourist restaurant fare
- **Lower costs:** Often cheaper than beachfront accommodation
- **Recovery focus:** [Yoga sessions](/experience), gardens, and space to stretch out
- **Easy access:** All spots are 10-20 minutes by motorbike

After a morning session, returning to a quiet farm with fresh food and hammocks hits different than fighting for a spot at a crowded beach bar.

## Surf Trip Essentials

**Board rental:** Available at Selong Belanak and Kuta. Bring your own if you're picky about equipment.

**Transport:** Rent a motorbike (50-75k IDR/day) to access different breaks. All spots are within 30 minutes of Kuta.

**Reef boots:** Recommended for reef breaks — sea urchins are real.

**Sunscreen:** The equatorial sun is no joke. Zinc up.

## Local Tips

> "The best sessions happen early — be in the water by 6:30am before the wind turns onshore. After surfing, the farm stays inland have way better food than most tourist spots in Kuta." — Local surfer

- Check the tides — many breaks work best at mid-tide
- Respect the locals — they know the waves and have priority
- Take rest days — the sun and waves will exhaust you
- Eat well — your body needs fuel to surf multiple sessions

## Plan Your Surf Trip

South Lombok delivers world-class waves without the Bali crowds. Whether you're learning at Selong Belanak or charging Ekas, you'll find your wave here.

Stay somewhere that supports your surfing — good food, good rest, good vibes. Your sessions will thank you.
