*Before picking up the clippers, we did a bit of research. What we landed on? A hard prune.*

## The Process

Armed with sharp secateurs, we spent an entire morning working through the vine:

1. Remove dead wood first
2. Cut at 45-degree angles
3. Leave 2-3 buds per spur
4. Think about shape

We're learning as we go, observing how the vines respond. That's the beauty of permaculture — it's a conversation with nature.
