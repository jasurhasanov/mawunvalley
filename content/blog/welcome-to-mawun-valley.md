# Welcome to Mawun Valley

We're a family-run farm in South Lombok, dedicated to sustainable living, permaculture education, and creating a community space where people can slow down and connect deeply.

## Our Philosophy

In a world that moves too fast, we've created a place where time slows down. Where strangers become family over shared meals. Where the rhythm of farm life replaces the noise of daily hustle.

### What We Believe

- **Farm to Table**: Everything we serve comes from our land or local neighbors
- **Community First**: You're not a guest, you're family
- **Slow Living**: Take your time. There's no rush here.

Come visit us and experience the magic of Mawun Valley.
