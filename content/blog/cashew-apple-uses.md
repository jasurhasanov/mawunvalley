*Learn to make cashew apple jam: Our [Cashew Apple Jam Cooking Class](https://megatix.co.id/events/cashew-apple-jam-cooking-class-at-mawun-valley-farm) teaches you to transform this rare fruit.*

While 95% of cashew apples go to waste globally, creative communities in tropical regions have found remarkable uses for this forgotten fruit. Here are 5 you've probably never heard of.

## 1. Cashew Apple Jam

This is our specialty at [Mawun Valley Farm](/gather). Cashew apple jam captures the fruit's unique sweet-tangy flavor in a shelf-stable form.

The process involves:

- Pressing fresh cashew apples to extract juice
- Slow cooking with sugar and citrus
- Creating a preserve that lasts months

The result? A jam unlike anything else — tropical, complex, and conversation-starting.

## 2. Feni: Cashew Spirit

In Goa, India, cashew apples are fermented and distilled into **feni** — a potent alcoholic spirit with protected geographical status (like Champagne or Tequila).

The process takes the fresh juice through double distillation, creating a clear spirit with a distinctive aroma. It's a cultural icon in Goa.

## 3. Fresh Juice (Same-Day Only)

In cashew-growing regions, fresh cashew apple juice is a delicacy — but only available immediately after harvest. The juice ferments within hours, so it can't be stored or transported.

If you visit a cashew farm during harvest season, ask to try fresh juice. It's a rare experience few tourists ever have.

## 4. Vinegar for Cooking

Cashew apple vinegar is made by allowing the juice to ferment completely. The result is a mild, fruity vinegar used in cooking throughout Brazil and parts of Asia.

It adds unique depth to:

- Salad dressings
- Marinades
- Chutneys and pickles

## 5. Natural Skincare

The high Vitamin C content of cashew apples has led to their use in traditional skincare. The fruit extract appears in some tropical skincare products for:

- Skin brightening (Vitamin C)
- Anti-aging (antioxidants)
- Hydration (high water content)

## Why These Uses Matter

Each of these uses transforms what would be agricultural waste into something valuable. At [Mawun Valley Farm](/experience), we believe in using what we grow — the cashew apple is too good to waste.

Our [cooking classes](/gather) teach visitors to make jam from our cashew harvest, continuing traditions that honor the whole fruit.
