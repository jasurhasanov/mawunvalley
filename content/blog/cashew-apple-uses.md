The cashew apple is one of the world's most wasted foods — millions of tons discarded annually. But in communities that know better, this forgotten fruit has surprising uses.

## 1. Cashew Apple Jam

When cooked with sugar and citrus, the fruit transforms into a beautiful amber jam with a unique flavor. At [Mawun Valley Farm](/gather), we make cashew apple jam and teach guests in our cooking classes.

## 2. Juice and Drinks

Fresh-pressed cashew apple juice is common in Brazil and India. High in vitamin C and best consumed immediately.

**Cajuína** is a popular Brazilian clarified cashew juice — clear and shelf-stable.

## 3. Fermented Beverages

**Feni (India):** A Goan liquor made from cashew apples.
**Caju Wine (Brazil):** Fermented juice, similar to cider.
**Cashew Vinegar:** Made from fermented juice.

## 4. Candied and Dried Fruit

- Sun-dried into chewy snacks
- Candied in sugar syrup
- Pickled in spiced brine

## 5. Skincare Applications

Cashew apple extract is gaining interest in cosmetics:
- Antioxidant properties for anti-aging
- Vitamin C for brightening
- Natural acids for gentle exfoliation
