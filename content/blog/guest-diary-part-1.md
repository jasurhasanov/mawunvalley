*Selamat Datang. Welcome. A fifteen-minute drive from Kuta, nestled in the countryside of South Lombok, lies Mawun Valley — a blissful haven that differs from your average farm stay.*

This verdant retreat offers hospitality in the form of [Noni's delicious cooking](/nonis) at her cafe, made with homegrown produce, and cosy [huts on the hill](/stay) where guests can sojourn. The family-run farm is a genuine way to connect with nature and one's inner child, and is suited for the whole family.

## The Grand Entrance

You enter and walk up a path lined with a wooden framework built to support the grapevines, intended to one day intertwine and cover the entire structure. Its central placement makes it feel like a grand entrance, turning your eye towards the budding surroundings.

On the left hand side of the path is a **herbal remedies garden**, housing aloe vera, rosemary, mint, tarragon and more. Mawun is here to aid your cough and blocked nose! On the right hand side there are green beans and long beans crawling up their frame, as well as a selection of rising vegetables.

In addition to the usual produce you have in your kitchen at home, here grows something more rare — **Jabuticaba**, a Brazilian grape tree where the fruit, which looks like a plum, grows directly on the trunk and branches of the tree through a process known as cauliflory. A fascinating sight!

## The Stars of the Show

The stars of the show are undoubtedly the **goats**. Spinach, Onion, Coconut, Sonic — to name a few. They are lively sprites and super affectionate.

Mini Coconut was born just within the past week and we all got to witness her mother give birth! An incredible thing to witness. They are like little puppies, especially Spinach who has ears like a basset hound.

## Noni's Cafe

At the far end of the farm you will find **Noni's cafe**, nestled behind the amphitheatre which allows you to watch the theatrics of the farm.

In a world of ultra-processed living, Mawun is not just wholesome in the sense of being around goats and kittens, but it allows you to eat **whole foods** and adopt a healthy lifestyle as a refuge from urban life. Noni's cafe offers food that is fresh and delicious.

> Eating the food at Noni's is nostalgic and it feels like home, reminiscent of my own mum picking vegetables from the patch in our garden and cooking a fresh plate of goodness.
