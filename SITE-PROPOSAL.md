# Mawun Valley Farm - Site Architecture Proposal

## The Philosophy First

Before structure, let's establish the soul of this site:

**Mawun Valley Farm isn't selling experiences — it's offering an invitation.**

An invitation to:
- Slow down in a world that demands speed
- Connect with land, animals, and community
- Remember what it feels like to get your hands dirty
- Find your rhythm between mountains and sea

The site should feel like the farm itself: unhurried, warm, authentic, and deeply rooted.

## Core Audiences

1. **The Seekers** — Digital nomads, burnt-out professionals, travelers looking for meaning
2. **The Families** — Parents wanting children to touch soil, meet animals, understand food
3. **The Surfers** — Wave chasers wanting more than a hostel between sessions
4. **The Learners** — People interested in permaculture, organic farming, slow living
5. **The Locals** — Expat families, Indonesian families looking for weekend escapes

**Photography:** Real farm, real people, no stock
**Icons:** Quick scanning like Worldpackers
**Space:** Generous whitespace — the site should breathe
**Mobile:** Most visitors on phones, thumb-friendly

## The Feeling

When someone leaves, they should feel:

1. **Curious** — "I want to know more"
2. **Calm** — "Even the website felt peaceful"
3. **Welcome** — "They seem like people I'd like"
4. **Clear** — "I know exactly how I could engage"
5. **Inspired** — "This is the kind of life I want to touch"

## Build Phases

**Phase 1:** Homepage + Stay + Contact
**Phase 2:** Experience + Gather
**Phase 3:** Belong + Retreat + Gift

*"The goal is not to build a website. The goal is to extend the invitation of the farm to anyone, anywhere, who might need it."*
