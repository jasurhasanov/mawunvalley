    <p class="intro"><em>Selamat Datang. Welcome. A fifteen-minute drive from Kuta, nestled in the countryside of South Lombok, lies Mawun Valley — a blissful haven that differs from your average farm stay.</em></p>

    <p>This verdant retreat offers hospitality in the form of <strong>Nonis delicious cooking</strong> at her cafe, made with homegrown produce, and cosy huts on the hill where guests can sojourn. The family-run farm is a genuine way to connect with nature and ones inner child, and is suited for the whole family.</p>

    <h2>First Impressions</h2>
    
    <p>You enter and walk up a path lined with a wooden framework built to support the grapevines, intended to one day intertwine and cover the entire structure. Its central placement makes it feel like a grand entrance, turning your eye towards the budding surroundings.</p>
    
    <p>On the left hand side of the path is a <strong>herbal remedies garden</strong>, housing aloe vera, rosemary, mint, tarragon and more. On the right hand side there are green beans and long beans crawling up their frame, as well as a selection of rising vegetables.</p>

    <p>In addition to the usual produce you have in your kitchen at home, here grows something more rare — <strong>Jabuticaba</strong>, a Brazilian grape tree where the fruit, which looks like a plum, grows directly on the trunk and branches of the tree through a process known as cauliflory.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">The stars of the show — Spinach, Onion, Coconut, and friends</p>

    <h2>The Stars of the Show</h2>
    
    <p>The stars of the show are undoubtedly the <strong>goats</strong>. Spinach, Onion, Coconut, Sonic — to name a few. They are lively sprites and super affectionate.</p>
    
    <p>Mini Coconut was born just within the past week and we all got to witness her mother give birth! An incredible thing to witness. They are like little puppies, especially Spinach who has ears like a basset hound. Some might say they are the life and soul of the farm.</p>
    
    <p>Coconut and Mini Coconut have become the best of friends, resting their necks on each other as they lay down to snooze and calling out when they lose sight of one another.</p>

    <h2>Nonis Cafe</h2>
    
    <p>At the far end of the farm you will find <strong>Nonis cafe</strong>, nestled behind the amphitheatre which allows you to watch the theatrics of the farm and its performance of agriculture. The banana plant leaves dance in the breeze just behind the Strawberry Fields — a guest was inspired by The Beatles Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club when naming this area.</p>

    <p>Passionfruit, dragonfruit, strawberries and mangoes. A citrus garden beginning to bloom. Tomatoes scaling the sunlit slopes while jackfruit dangle like natures ornaments from the trees. Mawun has an array of fruit, vegetables and herbs — the setup for perfect meals.</p>

    <p>In a world of ultra-processed living, Mawun allows you to eat <strong>whole foods</strong> and adopt a healthy lifestyle as a refuge from urban life. Eating the food at Nonis is nostalgic — it feels like home.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Noni tells me how having her cafe here is a dream come true. She was taking online orders for cakes when living in Kuta, but now being able to bake in a calm rural setting is everything she could have wished for.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Her baking is sensational — the cinnamon rolls are mouth-watering and the bouncy brownie cheesecake is understandably a best seller. But beyond her skills in the kitchen, her warmth and wisdom has made me feel at home here on the farm.</p>

    <h2>The Lodges</h2>
    
    <p>Each lodge is named uniquely with beautiful painted signs, giving the accommodation added charm. The Lime hut, where I am staying, is situated just next to the citrus garden — painted green and yellow to accompany the neighbouring lemons and limes. Each cabin is warmly furnished with a fan and a plush, comfortable bed.</p>

    <p>There is a Heal Hill — a chilled corner beyond the vegetable patches and nursery. There you can enjoy the view over the farm and the landscape beyond. A picture perfect view, whether in the daytime relaxing, or gathered around the fire pit at night.</p>

    <h2>A Day in My Life at Mawun</h2>
    
    <p>It is early morning and I have risen around 6:30am. An early start is perfect when on top of the Heal. A few of us start the day with yoga, with the kittens accompanying our sun salutation.</p>
    
    <p>As we salute the sun towards the end of the ritual, the sun rays caress our faces, spilling over the adjacent hills. By 8am Im sitting with the kittens who sleep peacefully atop the amphitheatre whilst I enjoy a Lombok coffee.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Sunrise yoga on Heal Hill with the best company</p>

    <p>I then enjoy my omelette with the other guests — cooked with fresh spring and white onions and juicy tomatoes, all Mawuns own.</p>
    
    <p>I set out to explore South Lombok on a rented moped, visiting <strong>Selong Belanak beach</strong> for a surf or to relax on the white sand. Then I return in the afternoon to the tranquility of the farm, feasting on a homemade fresh fluffy cinnamon roll baked by Noni.</p>
    
    <p>In the evening we indulge in a spread that Noni and the kitchen team provide — fried tofu, tempeh, chicken, sometimes a saucy yellowfin fish. Then play football or various games until we settle into the quiet of our cabins. A beautiful day in the Lombok hills.</p>

    <h2>At Night</h2>
    
    <p>Various string lights dotted around the farm illuminate the area, hanging above the amphitheatre to make it feel cosy. Some evenings theres a chance to roast marshmallows on a campfire. Guests and staff mingle and become a family-like unit during each persons stay at Mawun Valley.</p>

    <h2>Sustainability at Heart</h2>
    
    <p>Sustainability lies at the heart of Mawun Valley, evident in the improvement of soil pH and the enrichment of the ground. The compost pile at the far end of the farm uses only organic waste to create natural fertilizer.</p>
    
    <p>The farm also uses <strong>Olla irrigation</strong>, an ancient water-saving method that uses clay pots in the soil to hold water and then release it slowly to the surrounding plants. It reduces water usage and encourages roots to stretch deeper into the ground.</p>

    <h2>Why Mawun Valley?</h2>
    
    <p>I grew up spending my summers camping in North Wales, United Kingdom. For me, the farm brings up strong feelings of nostalgia when seeing children run around near the animals. It is reminiscent of a life removed from superficial spaces — dirtying ones hands and feet, no screens or distractions. Just simple, stripped back time spent with loved ones.</p>
    
    <p>It is a place I wish my family could visit with me, but I do not feel homesick when staying at Mawun.</p>

    <p>You may view this green haven as a <strong>refined wilderness retreat</strong>, rather than just a glamping spot in rural Lombok. It lets people experience a new lifestyle, in addition to providing guests with an escape from their own.</p>
