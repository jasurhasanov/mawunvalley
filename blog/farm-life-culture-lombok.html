    <p>In a world that's always rushing, <strong>Mawun Valley Farm</strong> offers something increasingly rare: the space to slow down, connect deeply, and experience life at a gentler pace. Nestled in the tranquil hills of South Lombok, our family-run farm isn't just a place to stay — it's an invitation to rediscover what matters.</p>

    <h2>🐐 Farm Activities</h2>

    <h3>Feed the Goats</h3>
    <div class="activity-card">
      <div class="activity-card-image"><img src="../images/blog/goats.jpg" alt="Feeding goats at Mawun Valley Farm"></div>
      <div class="activity-card-content">
        <span class="distance">📍 Right here at the farm</span>
        <p>Start your morning by visiting our friendly goats. They're always excited for breakfast (and attention). It's a simple activity, but there's something deeply grounding about connecting with animals. Kids especially love this — though we've seen plenty of adults completely charmed too.</p>
      </div>

    <h3>🏐 Play Volleyball</h3>
    <div class="activity-card">
      <div class="activity-card-image"><img src="../images/blog/volleyball.jpg" alt="Volleyball at Mawun Valley Farm"></div>
      <div class="activity-card-content">
        <span class="distance">📍 Right here at the farm</span>
        <p>Our volleyball court is the heart of community life at the farm. Guests, staff, and local friends gather here for casual games that often turn into memorable evenings. No skill required — just a willingness to have fun. Games typically happen in the late afternoon when the heat mellows out.</p>

        <span class="distance">📍 Surrounding the farm</span>
        <p>The rice paddies surrounding Mawun Valley Farm offer some of the most peaceful walking in Lombok. Follow the narrow paths between fields, watch farmers at work, and let the rhythm of rural life wash over you. Best experienced at sunrise or late afternoon when the light turns everything golden.</p>

        <span class="distance">📍 Right here at the farm</span>
        <p>Noni's Cafe has become something of a legend among travelers in South Lombok. The signature cheesecake — rich, creamy, and made fresh — is worth the visit alone. Pair it with locally-roasted coffee and you've got the perfect afternoon ritual. The cafe overlooks the valley and is designed for lingering.</p>

        <p>Every Friday evening, the farm comes alive with our community BBQ. Guests, staff, and neighbors gather around the fire for grilled fish, satay, and traditional Indonesian dishes. There's usually music, always laughter, and often dancing. It's the perfect way to cap off a week at the farm.</p>

    <h2>🎨 Culture & Traditions</h2>

      <div class="activity-card-content">
        <span class="distance">📍 15–20 minutes from the farm</span>
        <p>The Sasak people are the indigenous inhabitants of Lombok, and several traditional villages near the farm welcome respectful visitors. Walk through neighborhoods of thatched-roof houses, learn about local customs, and witness daily life that's changed little over centuries.</p>

    <h3>🧵 Traditional Weaving (Tenun)</h3>
    <div class="activity-card">

        <span class="distance">📍 20–30 minutes from the farm</span>
        <p>Sasak weaving is a centuries-old tradition passed down through generations of women. Visit a weaving village to watch artisans create intricate textiles on traditional looms and learn about the symbolism woven into each pattern. The textiles make beautiful, meaningful souvenirs.</p>

        <p>Roll out your mat and breathe in the valley air. Morning yoga sessions at the farm offer a gentle start to the day, surrounded by birdsong and mountain views. Sessions are suitable for all levels. For a more immersive experience, visit Ashtari for yoga with spectacular ocean views.</p>

        <span class="distance">📍 Right here at the farm</span>
        <p>Before the world wakes up, find a quiet spot on the farm and sit in stillness. Many guests choose to put their phones away and embrace a few days offline. Read that book you've been carrying. Write in a journal. Have long conversations. Watch clouds. The world will still be there when you return refreshed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Philosophy of Slow Living</h2>
    <p>At Mawun Valley Farm, we believe that slowing down isn't about doing less — it's about being present for what you're doing. Whether you're feeding goats, learning to weave, or simply sitting with a cup of coffee, the invitation is the same: <strong>be here now</strong>.</p>
